# MC-Intrigue-SMP

##### Intrigue - Minecraft SMP  [Fabric]

I'm keeping track of a personal Minecraft modpack(specifically for clientside) changes here and also as a way to download the new update to the modpack whenever it's available. This is one of my first projects and I wanted to test a bit with new things to get to know about GitHub's system.

I assume there're better methods to share your modpack, so I'm open ears for guidances.
